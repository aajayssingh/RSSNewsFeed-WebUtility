"You really should think about anger management. You're reckless, and irresponsible, you can't just run and start firing." Studiocanal UK has debuted an official trailer for the French action movie Bastille Day, starring the always-awesome Idris Elba as a former CIA agent who goes to Paris, France to help with an anti-terrorism mission. However, as the quote above mentions, he seems to be more reckless than helpful. The cast includes Kelly Reilly and Charlotte Le Bon. This looks like it has some solid action, but more than anything it's great to watch Idris Elba kickin' some ass. I'm interested in checking this out. Take a look.

Here's the first trailer for James Watkins & Jill Gagé's Bastille Day, direct from YouTube:

"Here we go again, bro." Whoa! Where did this come from? No release date or any solid confirmation on filming, yet the first poster is now out. An early teaser poster for the upcoming Predator movie has been unveiled on the official Predator Facebook page (found via SlashFilm). According to early details, this film is actually a direct sequel to the original 1987 sci-fi feature starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. The poster only says "You'll never see him coming" and lists the title as The Predator, which perhaps means we'll only see one Predator this time around again. I'm definitely curious to know more about this. Check this out in full.

This should've been so much better. The story is so good, but the filmmaking is just so bad, and it deserved better. Alone in Berlin is a film directed by Vincent Perez telling the story of Otto Quangel (in real life: Otto Hampel), a German living in Berlin during WWII that decided to write post cards with "free press" notes opposing Hitler and his regime. It was one of the most awkward screening experiences I've ever had - sitting in a theater full of German critics, in Berlin for the Berlin Film Festival, watching a film set in Berlin, but everyone in the film speaks English with German accents. One of the worst decisions they made. Even though I understand it's about getting this film to a wider audience, it just doesn't work, the performances are stilted, and everything seems off for the entire film. Which is unfortunate because I do love Otto's story.

"You've been gone too long, Alice. And do mind your step..." Disney debuted a new 90-second TV trailer for the Alice in Wonderland sequel during the Grammys this year. We've already featured one teaser trailer and the Super Bowl TV spot for Alice Through the Looking Glass, directed by James Bobin, but this one has even more trippy, colorful footage of Alice's journey through time and space. The big bad villain in this one is Time, metaphorically and psychically manifested as a character played by Sacha Baron Cohen. In addition, everyone is back: Mia Wasikowska as Alice, the late Alan Rickman as the Blue Caterpillar, with Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway, and Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat. You have to see this footage for yourself - I'm actually very impressed by this trailer. Consider me curious.

After earning excellent buzz at its world premiere at the Berlin Film Festival, Warner Bros has unveiled a new trailer for Jeff Nichols' sci-fi Midnight Special. The film stars Jaeden Lieberher as a boy named Alton with special powers, on the run with his father, Michael Shannon, along with Joel Edgerton. Also starring Adam Driver, Kirsten Dunst and Sam Shepard. It's best not to say anything else, because this is a movie to go see knowing as little as possible before. I wrote a rave review from Berlin, saying the "film relies heavily on the mystery, the ambiguity of the world we live in, and how we don't/won't understand everything. But we can be awe-struck by it." Enjoy.

"Ladies & gentlemen, welcome to Episode 8!" Disney/Lucasfilm have launched a very short hype video to announce the official start of production on Star Wars: Episode VIII (which still doesn't have a title), being directed by Rian Johnson from a screenplay also written by Rian Johnson (Looper, The Brothers Bloom, Brick). This video doesn't show any footage, but does include a tiny glimpse of the return of Luke Skywalker, played by Mark Hamill, who was barely in The Force Awakens. Obviously we will be following along as they continue shooting for the next few months. Check out the short announcement video below.

The best of the best - that you didn't see last year. We have returned with another set of worth watching, underseen films from 2015. Back again is our ninth annual list of the 19 Best Movies That You Didn't See in 2015 (past lists here: 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007). Featured below is a hand-picked line-up of the best independent and/or mainstream films that were either quietly dumped, ignored by audiences, or just not marketed well enough. So to give them extra attention in the spotlight, and to support some of the finest filmmakers out there, here is our best of 2015 recap. Read on for the full list!

"Don't open that door!!" Paramount has unveiled another trailer for Dan Trachtenberg's 10 Cloverfield Lane, better known as Valencia, which has nothing to do with Cloverfield but was given a Cloverfield title just so they could market it. This doesn't show anything more that we haven't seen in the first trailer, but it is cool to see. Mary Elizabeth Winstead stars as a woman who wakes up in an underground bunker after a car accident, but doesn't know what's out there or why she's stuck there. She's joined by John Goodman and John Gallagher Jr., and most of the film takes place in the bunker with these three. At least they're kind of admitting there might not be a Cloverfield monster outside saying: Monsters come in many forms.

<p><em>"Don't open that door!!"</em> Paramount has unveiled another trailer for Dan Trachtenberg's <strong><em>10 Cloverfield Lane</em></strong>, better known as <strong><em>Valencia</em></strong>, which has nothing to do with <em>Cloverfield</em> but was given a <em>Cloverfield</em> title just so they could market it. This doesn't show anything more that we haven't <a href="http://www.firstshowing.net/2016/first-trailer-for-dan-trachtenbergs-mysterious-10-cloverfield-lane/">seen in the first trailer</a>, but it is cool to see. <strong>Mary Elizabeth Winstead</strong> stars as a woman who wakes up in an underground bunker after a car accident, but doesn't know what's out there or why she's stuck there. She's joined by <strong>John Goodman</strong> and <strong>John Gallagher Jr.</strong>, and most of the film takes place in the bunker with these three. At least they're kind of admitting there might not be a Cloverfield monster outside saying: <em>Monsters come in many forms.</em> <a href="http://www.firstshowing.net/2016/watch-short-new-trailer-for-dan-trachtenbergs-10-cloverfield-lane/" title="Continue reading">???</a></p>

Last night, the United Kingdom had their big night for Hollywood at the 69th BAFTA Awards, honoring the best in film from last year (2015). These awards don't really have a major influence on the Oscars, but it's always interesting to see who our friends across the pond decide to hand out awards to. The selection of winners this year is quite diverse, with all of the best films from last year winning at least once in different categories. The Big Short won for Best Screenplay, Brooklyn won for Best British Film, The Hateful Eight won for Best Soundtrack, Inside Out won for Best Animation, Mad Max: Fury Road won for Best Hair & Make-Up, and The Revenant won for Best Film, just to start. Read on for the full list of 2016 winners below.

"Who you gunna call?!" These teasers for trailers really suck. We have stopped posting them but are making an exception this one time just because the actual trailer won't hit until March - a few weeks away. Sony has debuted a very brief teaser trailer for Paul Feig's Ghostbusters, the upcoming reboot of the supernatural comedy franchise. This barely shows any footage and doesn't show any of the main characters or anything else - but it does have a good shot of the new logo! That's about it. This stars: Kate McKinnon as Jillian Holtzmann, Leslie Jones as Patty Tolan, Melissa McCarthy as Abby Yates, and Kristen Wiig as Erin Gilbert, plus Chris Hemsworth as Kevin. We'll keep an eye out for more updates before the trailer arrives.

I still can't believe I'm saying this. Lee Tamahori, director of Die Another Day (one of my least favorite Bond movies) and other junk like xXx: State of the Union, has actually made a rather wonderful film. I'll admit - I kinda loved it. Maybe because I really had no idea what to expect. The Patriarch, also known as Mahana, is a film about the Mahana family in New Zealand. It's set during the 1960s and focuses on one boy in the family named Simeon, played by Akuhata Keefe who is the only one, out of about 20 members, to ever challenge and speak out against the patriarch of the family, played by Temuera Morrison. It's an uplifting story about how things can change over generations, and it's just as fun to watch as it is inspiring.

"You want some advice, Baker? Go back home to the beach, man, come back when you've lived a little..." IFC Films has debuted a trailer for the indie film Born to Be Blue, which stars Ethan Hawke as jazz legend Chat Baker. The film premiered at TIFF but never got any real buzz - this is the first time I've even heard about it. It's supposedly a creative blend of "fact with fiction" that "unfolds with all the stylistic brio and improvisatory genius of great jazz." The cast includes Carmen Ejogo and Callum Keith Rennie. This really looks quite awful, even worse than musician film I Saw the Light, and that got abysmal reviews at TIFF as well. If you want to see a good film about a jazz legend, stick with Miles Ahead for now. Take look.

It's supposedly a creative blend of "fact with fiction" that "unfolds with all the stylistic brio and improvisatory genius of great jazz." The cast includes <strong>Carmen Ejogo</strong> and <strong>Callum Keith Rennie</strong>. This really looks quite awful, even worse than musician film <a href="http://www.firstshowing.net/2015/tom-hiddleston-is-hank-williams-in-i-saw-the-light-official-trailer/"><em>I Saw the Light</em></a>, and that got abysmal reviews at TIFF as well.

With just a few weeks left until the 88th Academy Awards, the Writers Guild of America has announced the winners of the 2016 WGA Awards.

What have fellow writers determined to be the best scripts of 2015? This year's top prizes go to Josh Singer & Tom McCarthy for writing Spotlight, as well as to Charles Randolph and Adam McKay for writing The Big Short. Tough break for Aaron Sorkin.

Surprising to see these two films winning over the other nominees, but they're also excellent films, so I can't complain.

The young boy they're watching over seems to have some sort of special powers that even he doesn't understand.

Universal has debuted another new red band trailer for the upcoming comedy The Boss, starring/written by Melissa McCarthy and directed by her husband Ben Falcone. The plot involves the richest woman in America, played by McCarthy, losing all of her money and everything she built after getting busted for insider trading. It gets really stupid when she comes up with an idea to start a brownie empire to reestablish herself. The final showdown in this trailer is scraping the bottom of the comedy barrel.

The Mission Is In The Memories. Lionsgate has debuted a trailer for an intriguing high-concept sci-fi film called Criminal, that is indeed about a couple of criminals, but also so much more. Ryan Reynolds plays a deceased CIA operative whose memories and thoughts are implanted into the mind of a criminal, played by Kevin Costner, who is recruited by the head of the CIA, played by Gary Oldman, to finish a mission. The cast includes Gal Gadot, Alice Eve, Scott Adkins, Antje Traue, Michael Pitt and Tommy Lee Jones as the Doc.

<p><em>The Mission Is In The Memories.</em> Lionsgate has debuted a trailer for an intriguing high-concept sci-fi film called <strong><em>Criminal</em></strong>, that is indeed about a couple of criminals, but also so much more. <strong>Ryan Reynolds</strong> plays a deceased CIA operative whose memories and thoughts are implanted into the mind of a criminal, played by <strong>Kevin Costner</strong>, who is recruited by the head of the CIA, played by <strong>Gary Oldman</strong>, to finish a mission.

"How far will he go?" Sony Pictures has released another new red band trailer for Louis Leterrier's The Brothers Grimsby, featuring even more crazy footage from this upcoming comedy starring Mark Strong and Sacha Baron Cohen as brothers that must team up to stay alive. We've seen a whole bunch of trailers for this over the last few months, including two full-length trailers already, so why not one more. The full cast includes Penélope Cruz, Isla Fisher, Rebel Wilson, and Scott Adkins. I'm enjoying whatever they keep showing us from this, hoping it's as funny as it looks. Sacha Baron Cohen looks to be doing some of his best character comedy work since Bruno and Borat. And I always enjoy seeing Mark Strong. Have fun.

"I'm so glad you're here! We've got a lot to talk about... So much to celebrate tonight." Drafthouse Films has unveiled a new trailer for Karyn Kusama's creepy horror-thriller The Invitation, about a dinner party that isn't exactly what it seems. The cast includes Michiel Huisman, John Carroll Lynch, Emayatzy Corinealdi, Tammy Blanchard, Mike Doyle and Lindsay Burdge. Following up the first teaser, this trailer finally gives us more of a look at what's waiting these guests of the party. "Don't tell me that this is normal!" There's some really eerie, unsettling stuff going on and the reviews seem to indicate it's wild. Rob Hunter from FSR says: "In addition to being a suspenseful and well-acted ride the film also looks fantastic."
